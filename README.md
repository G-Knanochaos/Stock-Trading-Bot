# Stock-Trading-Bot
Current Specs:
- Buys based on the current trend of stock within the Support and Resistance range. (buying if near resistance, selling if near support)
- Sells based solely on portfolio cleaning (any stock with 0 buystrength are sold, but are kept otherwise)
- Buys and Sells no matter what (even if a stock is not at its prime price, it buys)
- Doesn't use stop loss or limits

I am working to improve this program's effeciency and plan to make different versions for testing. If you do plan on using/testing this code while it is in development, make sure to check the config folder and change API_KEY and SECRE_KEY.
